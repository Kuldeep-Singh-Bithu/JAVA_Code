      SubArray
-> subarray is continous part of the array
-> maximum subArray can be n*(n+1)/2
-> every subarray is a subsequence but every subsequence is not a subarray.

       Subsequence 
-> subsequence is a sequence that can be derived an array by selecting zero or more 
-> elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.

-> Maximum subsequence is 2^n 

-> every subarray is a subsequence but every subsequence is not a subarray
